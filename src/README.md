# Design Principles

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favor composition over inheritance.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
* Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
* Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
* Talk only to your immediate friends.
* Don't call us, we'll call you (a low-level component never calls a high-level component directly).
